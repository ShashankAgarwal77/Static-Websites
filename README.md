# Static-Websites üåê

![Header Image](/Assets/Journey.png)

I started my journey of learning Web Development through creating Static Websites using HTML, CSS (and it frameworks such as Bulma, Materialize & Tailwind) and Javascript. I thought why not document them in single repository :)

## Omnifood - Food Delivery Company

Omnifood is an imaginary Food Delivery Company based in Ireland.

- The page purpose was to showcase their services and mobile application.
  To make good impact I developed the landing section of the page with parallax effect in the background image and hovering effect in the navigation bar and in button.
